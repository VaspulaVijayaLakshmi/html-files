    <h1>Backpacking vs. a language course abroad: which is a better gap year?</h1>

    Travel may be one of the greatest things you can do with your time on this Earth. It opens your eyes to new  <span class="spans"> cultures, exposes you to fantastic new cities and landscapes, and introduces you to interesting people</span> – you also learn a lot about yourself. Both backpacking and studying a language abroad are brilliant ways to see the world, so how do you decide which is right for you? Luckily, we’re on hand to help. Consider this your very own pro’s and con’s list to help you figure out how to spend your gap year before, during, or after university.

    Backpacking, literally carrying everything you need for an adventure and nothing more on your back, means you’re free to roam without limits. When it’s so easy to pack up and move elsewhere, there’s no need to stay in one place for longer than your attention span can handle. <span class="spans">It’s the easiest way to plan a jam-packed travel adventure, discovering endless new cities – and countries – as you please</span>. With no obligations rooting you to one place, your next destination is entirely up to you. If you’re looking to tick off lots of items on your bucket list, backpacking is a sure-fire way to do so.
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://studyabroad.shiksha.com/">Studying a language abroad</a> with classes to attend, and a host family to come home to, you’re officially tied to one city. As your language skills and knowledge of the city improve, you’ll start to feel like a local. You’ll have your favorite coffee shop, friends to go out with, and a good understanding of the culture. In effect, your new city and host family will become your home away from home, but, that doesn’t mean you’re stuck there. With weekends and day trips, you can get out of the city and into the surrounding towns and nature. If you’re studying in Europe, even other countries are just a couple hours away by train.</p>

        Gaining life skills
         Both as a backpacker and a student, you’re guaranteed to come away from your time abroad with a new set of life skills.<span class="spans"> In each case, you’re thrown into a crazy exciting environment where you have to learn very quickly how to communicate with new people, navigate a new culture, and create a new life for yourself abroad</span>. You’re in charge and your independence skyrockets. By managing your own time, transportation, studies, and social life, you’ll return home feeling more confident in your abilities. The extra bonus of studying abroad is that you’ll have gained the incredible ability to speak another language and converse with an entirely new community of people in their native tongue – something that seriously impresses future employers and university admissions officers.
